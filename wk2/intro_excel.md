# Intro to Spreadsheets

Spreadsheets are a way of storing and processing data in a table format.

There are many examples of spreadsheet software such as:

- Microsoft **Excel**
- Google **Sheets**
- Apple Numbers
- LibreOffice **Calc**

<br>

A spreadsheet can have one or more sheet. Each sheet contains **multiple cells** and all the cells are **organized in columns and rows**.

In this course we will focus on using Excel, however, 90% of the functionality we will use is also available in Google Sheets.
