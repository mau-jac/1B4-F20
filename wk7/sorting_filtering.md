## Be careful with Auto-sorting âš 

Excel can do many things "automatically" for us.

However, to do this, Excel makes some assumptions about how our spreasheets are organized and sometimes these assumptions are wrong.

> Be careful when sorting data and make sure that related fields are moving along with the data being sorted.	

<br>

In the animation below, notice how the selected range is the only thing being sorted. The neighbouring data that is related to those cells are not being sorted.
