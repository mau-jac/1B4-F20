Queries are commonly used for information spread across multiple tables. However, we will start with simple queries.

## Filtering is not a Query âš 

Beginners often confuse queries with filtering. 

There are some similarities and it is possible to "narrow" down the information we are looking for with **they are not the same thing.**

For example, a store might be interested in the following question:

**Which customers live in our area, are outside the city limits, and have placed an order at our store?** 

There are three pieces of information involved in answering this question:

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Use the Access database *Social_Sciences_Teachers.accdb* found in Teams under week 14 to complete the following tasks:

1. Create a query that returns all courses that are taught on Mondays and Wednesdays and that are worth more than 3 credits.
2. Create a query that will return all courses that start after 10am.
